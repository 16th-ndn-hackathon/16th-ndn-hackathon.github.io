- 2-4

**Targeted participant**
- People with NDN code development experience

**How does your proposal benefit NDN?**
- mmWave is one of the technologies anticipated with 6G. It extends the current bandwidth utilisation of EM spectrum for network communication.

**Briefly describe the tasks**
- The tasks for the project are based on ndnSIM and NYUSIM apps of NS3 simulation tools.
- The participants will have to combine ndnSIM and NYUSIM to create a hybrid app which can test any protocol/scheme based on ndnSIM to analyse its feasibility in 6G spectrum.

**Any specific tools or language**
- ndnSIM & NYUSIM (NS3 based apps)

**Expected outcomes**
- Test the outcome of simulating any existing/new protocol or scheme in the hybrid app developed by combining NYUSIM and ndnSIM in NS3.

**Any specific tools or language**
- TypeScript

**Expected outcomes**
- A prototype of VSCode plugin connecting to NDN Workspace.

## 4. Web of Trust Model for NDN Workspace

**Project Lead:**
- Yekta KocaoÄŸullar

**Prefered Team Size:**
- 2-4

**Targeted participant**
- People with NDN code development experience

**How does your proposal benefit NDN?**
- This project is a continuation to ongoing efforts of adding functionalities to NDN Workspace, aiming to convert the current trust model of the application to Web of Trust.

**Briefly describe the tasks**
- Fetch stranger certificate by keylocator
- Request POR certificate issued by every other known (authenticated) user
  - If my cert store has N other users, send N interests for each
  - If not getting at least one POR, request an ID Token Data
  - If ID Token Data not valid or non exist, abort as data verification failure
- Cross-sign stranger public key as POR certificate
- Putting POR certificate into cert store
- Notify the POR subject a new POR is generated, let it fetch by name
- POR subject serves all POR it received"

**Any specific tools or language**
- NDNts library, TypeScript

**Expected outcomes**
- The NDN Workspace application should now use cross signed certificates for inter-trust zone communications.

## 5. Dockerizing NDN

**Project Lead:**
- Nidhi Panchal

**Prefered Team Size:**
- 2-4

**Targeted participant**
- People with NDN code development experience

**How does your proposal benefit NDN?**
- Dockerization makes it easy to run NDN services, without needing to spend time installing dependencies etc.

**Briefly describe the tasks**
- Learn Docker if no relevant experience
- Create Dockerfile for each service
- Create Docker compose that will start up sample service (i.e. NLSR + NFD)
- Create image for build

**Any specific tools or language**
- Docker

**Expected outcomes**
- Starting up new NDN services will be efficient and easy. Modification for the environment is also made simpler, since only a few lines in the Dockerfiles need to be updated.

## 6. SDN + NDN with mini-NDN

**Project Lead:**
- Ziyang Xing

**Prefered Team Size:**
- 2-4

**Targeted participant**
- People with NDN code development experience

**How does your proposal benefit NDN?**
- Expanding the application scope of NDN is beneficial for achieving more functions

**Briefly describe the tasks**
- Expanding the application scope of NDN is beneficial for utilizing the controllers in SDN to operate NDN

**Any specific tools or language**
- python, shell, java

**Expected outcomes**
- In the SDN environment, achieving producer to consumer distribution of content,

## 7. NDN Traffic Trace: stateful analysis & replay

**Project Lead:**
- Junxiao Shi

**Prefered Team Size:**
- 2-4

**Targeted participant**
- People with NDN code development experience
